# Team Principal

An attempt to build an motorsport manager style game with python. 

## Current Status

There is no gameplay at the moment. The game simply calculates a random race result, points are updated accordingly. Points are reset at the end of the year.

Currently working on building screens for the UI (previews below) and fleshing out the database. The UI is built using custom tkinter.
